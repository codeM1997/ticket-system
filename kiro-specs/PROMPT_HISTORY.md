# Prompt History

This file records every user prompt submitted during spec-driven development of the Support Ticket Management System, along with any changes made to the generated output. It demonstrates that Kiro was used as a spec-driven tool — not just a code generator.

## Prompt 1 — Initial Project Spec Request

**Date:** 2026-07-04

**Prompt (summarised):**
> Build a Support Ticket Management System. Tech stack: React, Node.js + Express, SQLite via Prisma. Models: User (id, name, email, role), Ticket (id, title, description, priority, status, assignedTo, createdBy, createdAt, updatedAt), Comment (id, ticketId, message, createdBy, createdAt). State machine: Open→In Progress, In Progress→Resolved, Resolved→Closed, Open→Cancelled, In Progress→Cancelled. Invalid transitions rejected by backend, handled in frontend. Features: create/list/view/update tickets, status transitions, comments, keyword search + status filter, data persistence, input validation, meaningful error states in UI. Out of scope: auth, user management UI. Additional: README from clean clone, integration tests for state machine, no secrets committed, DB setup docs, prompt history file, submit to kiro-specs/ folder.

**Kiro output:**
- Generated `requirements.md` with 12 requirements covering all features, EARS-style acceptance criteria.

**User review & changes:** None — requirements accepted as-is, proceeded to design phase.

## Prompt 2 — Proceed to Design Phase

**Date:** 2026-07-04

**Prompt:**
> I have read the requirements. Lets proceed to the design phase.

**Kiro output:**
- Generated `design.md` with architecture diagram, API endpoint table, request/response shapes, state machine module, Prisma schema, project directory structure, 16 correctness properties, error handling strategy, and testing strategy (unit + PBT + integration).

**User review & changes:** Proceeded after review — model field corrections applied in Prompt 3.

## Prompt 3 — Correct Model Field Definitions

**Date:** 2026-07-04

**Prompt:**
> User is to have only id, name, email and role. Ticket has to have only id, title, description, priority, status, assignedTo, createdBy, createdAt, updatedAt. Comment has to have only id, ticketId, message, createdBy, createdAt. Please update.

**Reason for change:** Generated design added `createdAt` to User (not in spec) and used `assignee` as the Prisma field name instead of the specified `assignedTo`.

**Changes made to design.md:**
- Removed `createdAt` from `User` model in Prisma schema.
- Renamed Prisma field `assignee String?` to `assignedTo String?` on `Ticket` model.
- Updated all API response shape examples to use `assignedTo` instead of `assignee`.
- Updated Property 5 description to reference `assignedTo`.

## Prompt 4 — Add Frontend Validation Property

**Date:** 2026-07-04

**Prompt:**
> In Correctness Properties, add that frontend will not allow to hit the backend if there are validation errors on frontend.

**Reason for change:** The original spec covered backend validation but had no explicit correctness property or requirement for client-side validation blocking API calls.

**Changes made:**
- Added **Property 17** to `design.md`: "Frontend blocks API calls when client-side validation fails" — covers ticket create, ticket update, and comment create forms.
- Added **Requirement 13** to `requirements.md`: "Frontend Client-Side Validation" with 4 acceptance criteria covering form blocking, field-level error display, and submit button disabling.

---

## Prompt 5 — Proceed to Tasks Phase

**Date:** 2026-07-04

**Prompt (implicit):** User confirmed design was ready; Kiro proceeded to generate `tasks.md`.

**Kiro output:**
- Generated `tasks.md` with 22 top-level tasks, bottom-up ordering (scaffold → DB → state machine → backend routes → integration tests → frontend → docs), optional PBT sub-tasks marked `*`, full requirement traceability on each task.

**User review & changes:** Accepted as-is.

---

## Prompt 6 — Initialise Git Repo and Commit

**Date:** 2026-07-04

**Prompt:**
> Initialise the git repo and commit the current changes.

**Actions taken:**
- `git init`, renamed branch to `main`.
- Created `.gitignore` excluding `node_modules/`, `.env`, `*.db`, `*.sqlite`, `dist/`, `build/`, `coverage/`.
- Staged and committed all spec and project config files: `chore: initialise repo with spec documents and project config`.

---

## Prompt 7 — Push to GitHub

**Date:** 2026-07-04

**Prompt:**
> Now git push, I want to push to https://github.com/. I will provide the credentials as required.

**Remote URL provided:** `https://github.com/codeM1997/ticket-system.git`

**Actions taken:**
- Added remote origin.
- Push requires interactive credential input (GitHub PAT); user must run `git push -u origin main` manually.

---

## Prompt 8 — Create kiro-specs/ Folder with Artifacts and Prompt History

**Date:** 2026-07-04

**Prompt:**
> I have to submit tool-specific/kiro-specs/ with requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md. I have to show that I reviewed and improved the generated spec, that my implementation followed it, that I updated it when needed, and that I used Kiro as a spec-driven tool rather than only a code generator. You haven't created this folder with the required artifacts. Also, you haven't created a prompt history of up till now. Create prompt history in the above folder as well.

**Actions taken:**
- Created `kiro-specs/` directory.
- Copied `requirements.md`, `design.md`, `tasks.md` from `.kiro/specs/support-ticket-management/` into `kiro-specs/`.
- Created this `PROMPT_HISTORY.md` documenting all prior prompts and spec changes.

## Prompt 9 — Automate Prompt History Updates

**Date:** 2026-07-04

**Prompt (summarised):**
> User asked how prompt history would be maintained after every prompt, wanting to ensure it stays current automatically rather than requiring manual updates.

**Kiro output:**
- Created an `agentStop` hook (`update-prompt-history`) that fires after every agent turn and instructs the agent to append a new entry to `kiro-specs/PROMPT_HISTORY.md` if the prompt was meaningful.

**User review & changes:** None — accepted as-is.
